Gridfinity Cutlery

## Information
- Title:  `Gridfinity Cutlery`
- Printables: [https://www.printables.com/model/342919-gritfinity-cutlery]()

I wanted to have sorted all the cutlery but haven't found any Gridfinity models for it, so I tried to create it myself.

I created some forms for bigger spoons, normal forks and knifed.

All step files, so remixing should be doable, if needed I can also provide the Fustion360 Files directly.

## Files
- fork.step - Fitted for the forks
- knife.step - Fitted for the knifes
- spoon_knife.step - Fitted for bigger spoons and the rest for knifes
